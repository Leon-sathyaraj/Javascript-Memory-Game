# Memory Game

## *Why made me want to develop this game:*

Could not find a memory game that was similiar to what I did so decided to give myself a challenge to code one.

## *How did I approach coding the game:*

I wrote down my pesudo codes and break my objectives to bite size components. This way I know whether its a standalone function or it will be used in other functions.

## *How to play the game:*

4 correct images will be shown for 5 seconds. player will be given 8 seconds to pick the correct images.
the difficulty goes up by having less time to pick the correct answer and more images to choose from.


## *Things I learnt coding this project and challenges I faced:*

To put the codes together to make it work was the most challenging portion. 
The codes may work individually but when you put them together, it may not work.
I learn how to troubleshooting better in finding what is the bug that is causing the game,text or function to not worked as intended.

## *Features I want to implement:*

I love websites and even games that are interactive. Would like to add more sprites, random game features that will give player a different challenge each time they play the game.
