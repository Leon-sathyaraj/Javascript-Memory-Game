I want to develop a javascript game for a project. it will be accessed locally
 so assets can be stored in personal computer. the requirements of the game are below:

1) create a start button
2) once start button is clicked, there will be two text that appears one after the other
for 1.5 seconds. 'ready' and 'go!
3) randomize 8 images and backend will pick 4 to show players
4) the images will be shown for 5 seconds before it disappears
5) another text and a 3 seconds delay before showing the 8 images
6) players will choose the 4 correct images out of 8 images .
if correct, tell player he won and give option to go next round and repeat 2)
7)next round will repeat from step 2
9) if option is wrong , player lose the round and reveal the answer.
 give option to restart game aka go back to step 2.
 
10) if the time has reached 0, show the text ' time's up!' 
and delay is for 2 seconds then reveal the correct answer

11) after winning for 5 rounds, extend the options of 8 to 12 images to pick from

there should be only start button. the rest of it should seamlessly flow naturally.
theres seem to be a static clock. the timer should be done like the code i sent.
i came across a random 4 images where two of it is a picture of the blue can. 
but answers showed 1 can. take note of it

just wanted to bring up incase you completed it but not working as intended. when lose, should give a button option called 'retry'.
once retry button is clicked, it will restart the process from 'ready?' 'go!'
